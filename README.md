# unit-4-game
CrystalsCollector Game, Random Number will be displayed at the start of the game. 
There will be four crystals which have random Crystal Values displayed as buttons on the page. 
If the image is clicked, points will be added to the total score and if the total clicked points matches with the displayed number then the user will win. If the clicked images value did not match with the random number, then the user will lose the game and "loser" message will be displayed.

Side notes, 
The Game Should show total wins and loses and automotically restart with out refreshing the page.
I tried to add music effects when the user wins and losses respectively, However, that didn't come out as I expected and decided to continue building the game without sound effects.
